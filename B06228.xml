            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>Mr. CHARNOCKE'S Paper.</head>
               <p>THAT I might avoid diſtractions, and be Compoſed as much as poſſible at the time of my Execution, I thought it much more proper to Communicate This to the Sheriffs, than to give my ſelf the uneaſineſs of ſpeaking, leaving it to them to publiſh (if they ſhould think convenient) for the ſatisfaction of the World; and in what I have to ſay, I have taken as much care as I could to be ſhort, that I might not loſe time in my greateſt Concern.</p>
               <p>As concerning an Invaſion intended by King <hi>James</hi> upon <hi>England,</hi> and that there was certain Intelligence of it from Abroad, I preſume every body was ſatisfied; and to the facilitating of which, I own that my ſelf and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did agree upon the Undertaking, To Attack the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and his Guards, for which I am now to Suffer; but I think my ſelf obliged by all the Tyes imaginable, both of Conſcience and Honour, to declare, That as for any Order or Commiſſion of King <hi>James</hi>'s for Aſſaſſinating the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> I neither ſaw, nor knew of any; but have had frequent Aſſurances of his having rejected ſuch Propoſals when they have been Offer'd.</p>
               <p>I confeſs I did hear that there was a Commiſſion arrived for Levying of War, and which was natural to believe, if the King was in ſuch a readineſs to come over as was reported; but if there was any ſuch Authority as that, I declare I never ſaw it.</p>
               <p>As to what regards the Body of the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> I muſt do them this Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and which I dare be poſitive in, That they had no manner of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this Deſign, nor do I believe it was Communicated to any other Party of ſuch as are reputed the King's Friends, but carried on merely by a ſmall number, without the Advice, Conſent or Privity of any Parties whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
